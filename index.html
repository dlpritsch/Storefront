                There is no god, Summer; gotta
                rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. I took your family? Who
                do
                you think had taken more from them when you shot 2 Listen to your sister Morty; to live is to risk it
                all;
                otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe
                blows
                you.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

                It's a dream, Morty! We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and
                crapped your pants, we-we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside
                Snuffles' dream. Aw, man! I really liked this life! Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. Oh my
                god, how could I not see this coming? My lust, my greed! I deserve thiiiiii- Ladies, let's get out of
                here. </p><br><br><br><br><br>




            <h2>Jessica</h2>
            <p id="p3"><img src="img/Jessica.png" class="test" alt="red haired girl" style="float:left" ; />If you're
                talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event, unrelated to me. Like when you went to Pluto or fucked my
                daughter. God-damn! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a quick solo adventure to go on and this one will
                not be directed by Ron Howard. I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of
                ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah.

            <h3>Jacob Philip</h3>
            <p id="p4"><img src="img/Jacob_Philip.png" class="test" alt="Jacob" style="float:right" ; />Meeseeks don't
                usually have to exist for this long. It's gettin' weeeiiird. This aftershave made women want me, but it
                also made me impotent! Yea. If you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad,
                Morty. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes!</p><br><br><br><br><br>
